# VirTeX

VirTeX (pronounced vir-TEH-ks) is a command line interface for rendering and
displaying LaTeX on the virtual terminal.

The current ability of VirTeX is extremely limited, but we are working towards a
first release. Stay tuned.

## Getting Started

We're not quite there yet, but we'll let you know when we know.

## Running tests

Tests from the `tests` directory may be run from the command line with
`scripts/runTestSuite`.
